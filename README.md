# Symmetrich üéØ


## Basic Details

### Project Description
Symmetrich is an AI-powered web application built with Streamlit that evaluates the visual symmetry of sandwiches from an uploaded image. It uses a NumPy-based image processing algorithm to calculate a precise symmetry score, while Google's Gemini AI is leveraged to find the sandwich, analyze its contents, and generate a witty, sarcastic critique. The application is complete with secure user accounts, a persistent personal history of submissions, and a polished, interactive UI with custom effects.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
When was the last time that you were 100% sure that you had a perfectly symmetrical sandwich? You cut it in half and is sure that the 2 halves are equal? Never . I bite in with hope, only to find all the fillings hiding on one side like they were avoiding rent.  Crooked cheese. Lopsided lettuce. Misaligned meats. Sandwich asymmetry is the silent crisis ruining lunches everywhere.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built Symmetrich‚Äîan AI-powered judge, jury, and roaster for sandwich symmetry. Upload your sandwich photo, and it delivers a symmetry score with laser precision and a sarcastic critique you didn‚Äôt ask for but absolutely deserve. It‚Äôs time we hold sandwiches (and their makers) accountable. Finally, visual justice for lunch
